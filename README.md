## FAQ

#### Why does my program stops after 5 seconds

We need to stop the process after 5 seconds so that rest of the programs in queue can also execute

#### Why cant i create any other class other than Main.java

For java files i have created a Main.java file only to execute it but in future i am going to add that feature as well
